## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Domain Application**: Select and work within a specific application domain (healthcare, finance, justice, etc.)
2. **Model Comparison**: Implement and compare one interpretable model with one black-box model
3. **Interpretability Analysis**: Apply both local and global post-hoc interpretability methods
4. **Critical Evaluation**: Assess trade-offs between model performance and interpretability
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate and test a clear hypothesis about interpretability methods

## Detailed Methodology and Approach

### 1. Domain Selection and Problem Formulation

**Step 1.1: Choose Application Domain**
- Select from domains where interpretability is crucial:
  - Healthcare (medical diagnosis, treatment recommendations)
  - Finance (loan approval, credit scoring, fraud detection)
  - Justice (risk assessment, sentencing recommendations)
  - Other relevant domains with ethical/regulatory requirements

**Step 1.2: Define Research Hypothesis**
Formulate a testable hypothesis, such as:
- "SHAP provides more robust and consistent local explanations than LIME"
- "Interpretable models lead to similar conclusions as black-box models but are easier to justify"
- "Permutation importance better captures global feature relevance than SHAP"
- "Neural networks outperform random forests in predictive accuracy while maintaining explainability"

### 2. Data Selection and Preprocessing

**Step 2.1: Dataset Requirements**
- Choose datasets relevant to your selected domain
- Ensure features are inherently interpretable (avoid black-box feature engineering)
- Document dataset origin, size, features, and target variables

**Step 2.2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Conduct comprehensive EDA including:
- Summary statistics for all variables
- Missing data analysis and handling strategies
- Feature distributions and outlier detection
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Target variable distribution and class balance
- Domain-specific visualizations

**Step 2.3: Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Apply feature transformations that maintain interpretability
- Ensure feature engineering results in human-meaningful variables
- Document all preprocessing decisions and their rationale

### 3. Model Implementation

**Step 3.1: Interpretable Model Selection**
Choose from:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

**Step 3.3: Model Training and Evaluation**
- Implement proper train/validation/test splits
- Use appropriate cross-validation strategies
- Report standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)
- Justify model architecture and hyperparameter choices

### 4. Interpretability Methods Implementation

**Step 4.1: Local Interpretability Methods**
Implement and apply:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
  - TreeExplainer for tree-based models
  - LinearExplainer for linear models
  - KernelExplainer for black-box models
